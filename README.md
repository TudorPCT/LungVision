# LungVision

The bachelor's thesis focuses on the design and implementation of a medical prediction system using machine learning to assist healthcare professionals in the diagnostic process of one of the lung diseases: pneumonia, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. It presents both the details of building a suitable convolutional neural network model and the architecture and implementation of a web application serving as the interface. To achieve this goal, a client-server architecture was used, along with a diverse tech stack, including Angular for the frontend, Java for the backend, and Python for the development and interaction with the machine learning models.
